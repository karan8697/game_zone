				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 news_news">
					<p style="overflow-wrap: break-word;padding: 30px;">
						Like clockwork, Nvidia has announced a new architecture for its GPUs, and it's debuting it in a range of Founder’s Edition graphics cards that feature an all-new design befitting a new direction for the company. While the RTX 2080 could be considered the standard card in the 20XX-series lineup, the RTX 2080 Ti is the top dog in terms of raw performance (and its unusually high $1,200 price tag). All of the new GPUs from Nvidia feature specialized "Turing" hardware that will allow them to eventually offer features like real-time ray tracing and artificial intelligence-powered super sampling, so there's more to this GPU than just sheer horsepower. I've spent the past week putting it through its paces, so let's dive in.
						<br><br>
						I spent some time—a lot of time, actually—putting the RTX 2080 Ti through its paces in both real-world and synthetic benchmarks. I ran all the tests on a hand-built system that was used for the Pascal GPUs, and it consists of a Skylake Core i7-7700K CPU, 8GB of DDR4 memory, an Asus Z270 Prime motherboard, Intel SSD, and EVGA PSU. I tested this card (and all others) at 3840 x 2160, 2560 x 1440, and 1920 x 1080 resolutions with all games and benchmarks set to their highest graphical settings, but without anti-aliasing activated.

						WSJ Japan’s sources reportedly told the publication that there are active discussions about new hardware and software functions and the cost to implement them – including upgrading the system’s “low-end” LCD display. The sources also indicated this new Switch could arrive in the second half of 2019, and perhaps as early as the Northern Hemisphere summer.

						At last report, Nintendo Switch console sales had reached nearly 20 million units sold.For IGN's current thoughts on the console, check out our recent 2018 re-review of the Nintendo Switch which, a year and a half after release, has certainly delivered on its initial promise of allowing us to play high-quality games both at home and on the go.

						Being developed internally by a "small and dedicated team" within Mojang, the developer describes Minecraft: Dungeons as an "action-adventure game inspired by classic dungeon crawlers." It'll support up to four players and feature various new weapons, items, and mobs, as well as a variety of environments to explore and an overarching quest that'll see players face off against an enemy called the Arch-Illager.

						The footage was shared on Reddit by VapeThisBro, who recorded the footage secretly while in a survey group at a mall. He said that signs in the lobby of the place read that no phones or cameras were allowed, but the company performing the survey neglected to check him.Reddit users began commenting about his legitimacy and if an NDA was signed, in which, VapeThisBro explained the company in charge of the surveys forgot to have him sign his NDA before he finished watching the video and left.

						VapeThisBro on Reddit: "BUT while they had everyone else sign NDAs I guess I left before they remembered I needed to sign one too".

						Layden made the announcement on the PlayStation Blogcast, saying "For 2018, I know this is going to be a disappointment to some people, but we decided to not hold PlayStation Experience this year.We won't have it in the States this year," he continued. "The reasons behind that really are we don't have...we have a lot of progress that we're making on our games...Now that we have Spider-Man out the door, we're looking down into 2019 games like Dreams and Days Gone.
						<br><br>
						Part of our commitment is that going forward we're going to amp that up, we're going to crank [those] communications [up]...and find more ways to get our message out and get a view into what our activities are and what our hopes and dreams are, if you will, for PlayStation and for Worldwide Studios," he explained.While last year's PlayStation Experience was not as news heavy as in years' past, PSX 2016 saw the announcement of both The Last of Us Part 2 and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy's reveal.

				<div class="col-sm-12 news_news">
					<p style="overflow-wrap: break-word;padding: 30px;">
						Though Bowsette is a character that took the internet by storm, it isn’t a real Nintendo creation, rather fan art that was spawned from the odd introduction of Peachette during this month’s jam packed Nintendo Direct. Or, at least we thought this idea of a  Bowser and Princess Peach combination was entirely made up by fans, until today’s release of The Art of Super Mario Odyssey in Japan.
						<br><br>
						Twitter user Nao posted this shot of the book full of official concept art today. It allegedly shows a concept where Bowser throws a hat similar to Cappy that allows him to take over/capture Princess Peach’s body, effectively making this a more official version of Bowsette.
